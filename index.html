<h1>Welcome to the 6th Dallas Badminton Singles Championships!</h1>


<p>We are pleased to invite you to participate to the sixth Dallas Badminton Singles Championships, 
    powered by Swadeshi Plaza, at Frisco Badminton on Saturday March 23, 2019. 
The Singles Championships is a club-independent effort to promote the practice of singles in the Dallas Fort Worth area. 
<p> We provide participants with excellent playing conditions, including a gym with high ceiling and mats, very good shuttles 
    (BWF approved Youhe), and matches played in best of three 21 point games. 

<p>All participants get lunch and a take-home souvenir.



<p> We are very grateful to our host, Frisco Badminton, and to our generous sponsors Swadeshi Plaza
    and <a href="http://www.thesophiadesigngroup.com/index.html">the Sophia Design Group</a>  without whom we could not have created such event 
    at the affordable overall cost of $30 per participant.
